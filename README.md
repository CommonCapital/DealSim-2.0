Institutional Deal Pressure-Testing Engine
<em>"Given this deal, what breaks first under real capital scrutiny?"</em>

## ⚡ Overview

**DealSim** is an institutional-grade pressure-testing engine designed to simulate adversarial capital scrutiny before a GP walks into an IC, a founder meets a lead investor, or a deal team presents to an LP advisory board.

The gap in modern finance is not information; it is **structured adversarial scrutiny** applied early. DealSim fills this gap by allowing you to:
- **Map Investment Claims**: Extract the core logic of a deal into a verifiable graph.
- **Trigger Adversarial Audits**: Deploy specialized "Investment Archetypes" (The Skeptical Institutionalist, The Growth Optimist, The Financial Engineer) to stress-test your assumptions.
- **Identify Fragility**: Discover "what breaks first" through a 5-stage simulated Investment Committee (IC) loop.

## 🚀 DealSim 2.0: 100% Local & Cost-Effective (No Zep Cloud Required)

Unlike the original version of DealSim which heavily relied on **Zep Cloud** (a paid, external GraphRAG and entity extraction service costing up to $350+/month), **DealSim 2.0 is fully local out-of-the-box**:
- **Zero Cloud Memory Dependencies**: All knowledge graph ontology generation, claim parsing, entity extraction, and temporal relationship mapping are processed locally via custom drop-in local client architecture (`LocalZep`).
- **Substantial Cost Savings**: Completely eliminates the need for expensive Zep Cloud subscriptions and massive external API bills.
- **Privacy & Performance**: Sensitive investment memoranda, financial sheets, and pitch decks never leave your machine, running with extremely low offline latency.

### 💡 Statement in Plain English

*DealSim* is a software tool that stress-tests investment deals before they face real investors.

**The problem:** When a fund manager or founder walks into an investment committee (IC) or investor meeting, that's usually the first time their deal gets seriously challenged. By then, weeks of work and real credibility are already on the line. Catching flaws that late is expensive and embarrassing.

**What it does:** You upload your pitch deck, financial model, and assumptions memo. The system breaks the deal down into every specific claim you're making — things like "our retention is 120%" or "we'll exit at 12x." It then runs those claims through 50–100 simulated capital allocators (a skeptical VC, a conservative PE partner, a family office, a regulatory reviewer, etc.), each applying their real-world decision criteria. They attack your claims across five structured stages, essentially mimicking what a real IC process looks like.

**The output** is a single clean report telling you: which claims break first, what the most common objections are, what information gaps will get flagged, which investor types would pass vs. proceed, and — crucially — exactly what evidence or changes would flip a "no" into a "maybe."

**The value in one sentence:** It's a rehearsal room for your deal that tells you where you'll get destroyed before you walk into the room where it actually matters.

## 🔄 The DealSim 5-Stage Audit

1. **First Look (Quick Sanity Check)**: High-level review of deal structure and surface-level red flags.
2. **Full Pack Review (Detailed Examination)**: Exhaustive analysis of the investment memo and financial model.
3. **Cross-Examination (Adversarial Interrogation)**: Intensive questioning by agents with conflicting mandates (e.g., Growth vs. Capital Preservation).
4. **Diligence Surfacing (Identifying Gaps)**: Synthesizing information that *is not* in the document but *should be*.
5. **Final Verdict (Investment Decision)**: A GO/NO-GO recommendation based on the cumulative pressure-test.

## 📄 Architecture & Archetypes

DealSim shifts from personality-driven AI to **Mandate-driven AI**. Each "Persona" in the IC Room is bound by a specific investment mandate:
- **The Skeptical Institutionalist**: Focuses on downside protection and capital preservation.
- **The Financial Engineer**: Obsessed with EBITDA margins and exit multiples.
- **The Distressed Specialist**: Looks for where the deal breaks to find entry value.
